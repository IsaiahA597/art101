		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
		<p>The purpose of Lab 4 was to learn how to make Pseudocoding outlines before coding.</p>
		<h2>Lab 4: Challenges</h2>    
		<p>It took me and my partner a while to decide what simple game we could write a Pseudocode outline for.
			Even after deciding trying to use the correct terms for the Pseudocode was challenging. </p>  
		<h2>Lab 4: Results</h2>
		<p>I feel more confident about my first Pseudocode, but I did my best.</p>

			<pre><code>
				// create the grid board before each turn 
  					// loop through each row 
    					// loop through each space
      						// print a red circle or a yellow circle 
     						// print a line between 
    					// print a newline at the end
    					// print a horizontal line between
				// a player chooses a color and the sets of pieces
					// computer gets the color that is not picked by the player
				// ask the player for their move 
				// if the move is valid
					// execute the move on the board
					// check for any captures
					// check for a win condition
					// switch to the computer player
				// if the move is not valid
					// ask the player to make another move
				// accept user input
				// validate user move
				// evaluate possible moves
				// choose computer move
				// if the move is valid:
					// execute the move on the board
					// check for any captures
					// check for a win condition
					// switch to the player
				// test of win or draw condition

				// how to wash your hands
				// make sure you have all the necessary products, hand soap pumps or dispensers, access to a running sink, and a hand towel
				// wet your hands using the water from the running sink 
					// it can be cold or warm water
				// turn off the tab and apply the hand soap to the palm of one of your hands
				// rub your palms together
				// spread the soap by rubbing the back of your hands as well as in between your fingers
					// keep rubbing for at least 20 seconds
				// after 20 seconds turn on the sink again and rinse the soap off in the water while rubbing your hands
					// both palm and backhand
				// once the soap is all gone turn off the tap 
				// dry hands with the hand towel until your hands are dry enough
				// now your hands are clean of germs but always wash them when your hands get dirty again.
