			<h1>Lab 14 Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<p>The purpose of Lab 14 was to use this time to debug any of our past labs.</p>
			<h2>Lab 14: Challenges</h2>    
			<p>I had no problems or issues while working on this lab.</p>
			<h2>Lab 14: Results</h2>
			<p>My index.html ran successfully and it includes all the requirements from the instructions.</p>

				<h2>Debugging</h2>
				<p>While checking on my old pages from previous labs I noticed one of them had an issue.</p>
				<p>This being Lab 2, my image wouldn't display, it did when I first made the page.</p>
				<p>I originally didn't put the image in my project image folders and used a link instead.</p>
				<p>Now that I know how to input images and change their size I was able to fix the image for lab 2.</p>
				<p>This was my only lab that wasn't displaying properly, my other labs work fine.</p>
